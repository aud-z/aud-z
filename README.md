### Hi there! 

**I am Audrey - a music lover, creative problem-solver, and hot sauce enthusiast. Currently a Masters student in Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University.** 

I am fascinated with the role that data play in addressing society's complex solutions. Prior to grad school, I had the opportunity to help implement some very exciting Medicare innovation  programs. I analyzed Medicare claims data to construct key indicators for program impact and synthesized the results to create strategies for improvement. It was amazing to see data insights get translated into concrete policy action and measurable outcomes. Eager to learn more, I am taking these next two years to polish my technical skills so that I can bring a robust set of analytical capabilities, along with my humor and relentless intellectual curiosity, to wherever my next adventure may be. 

ðŸ“‘ What I've learned so far:  
- NLP, ML, neural networks/deep learning using Python
- Mathematical foundations of ML and deep learning
- Optimization & data science for business and products
- Statistical & econometrics analysis using R, SPSS, and STATA
- NoSQL database management 
- Big data and large-scale computing (Pyspark)
- Unstructured data analysis

ðŸŒ± What I'm up to now:
- summer internship @ BCG GAMMA 
- diving head-first into the real world and learning how to productionalize ML models for deployment at scale 

âš¡ Fun facts:
- avid (solo) traveler
- Muay Thai student 
- bookworm
