### Hi there! My name is Audrey, and I am currently a masters student in Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. As a public policy nerd, I am fascinated with the role that data play in addressing society's complex solutions. In my last role, I had the opportunity to work with the federal government to implement some very exciting Medicare innovation pilot programs, and part of my role included analyzing Medicare claims data to measure key performance indicators and identify strategies for maximizing program impact. I am now working on strengthening my technical skills so that I can bring a robust set of analytical capabilities, along with an easygoing personality and relentless intellectual curiosity, to whereever I may find myself after grad school. 

ðŸ”­ What I know and am continuing to improve upon: 
- Java
- Python 
- SQL
- Excel 
- R 

ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning:
- Machine learning and AI 
- Social media analysis
- Database management 
- Econometrics 

âš¡ Fun fact:
- avid solo traveler 
- novice Muay Thai enthusiast 
- bookworm
