### Hi there! 

**I am Audrey, currently a masters student in Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University.** 

As a public policy nerd, I am fascinated with the role that data play in addressing society's complex solutions. I had the opportunity to work with the federal government to implement some very exciting Medicare innovation pilot programs, and part of my responsibilities included analyzing Medicare claims data to measure key performance indicators and identify strategies for maximizing program impact. It was amazing to see data insights get translated into concrete policy action. Eager to learn more, I am taking these next two years to polish my technical skills so that I can bring a robust set of analytical capabilities, along with my quirky humor and relentless intellectual curiosity, to wherever my next adventure may be. 

ðŸ”­ What I know and am continuing to improve upon: 
- Basic OOP in Java
- OOP and data anaysis in Python, including natural language processing and machine learning  
- SQL for database 
- Excel, Tableau for data analysis and visualization
- R, STATA, SPSS for statistical analysis 

ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning:
- Machine learning and AI applications in data science 
- Social media analysis for market, corporation, and consumer trends 
- Database management and design
- Applied econometrics and statistical methods
