### Hi there! 

**I am Audrey - a music lover, creative problem-solver, and hot sauce enthusiast. Currently a Masters student in Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University.** 

I am fascinated with the role that data play in addressing society's complex solutions. Prior to graduate school, I had the opportunity to help implement some very exciting Medicare innovation pilot programs. My responsibilities included analyzing Medicare claims data to construct key indicators for program impact, and synthesizing the results to create strategies for improvement. It was amazing to see data insights get translated into concrete policy action and measurable outcomes. Eager to learn more, I am taking these next two years to polish my technical skills so that I can bring a robust set of analytical capabilities, along with my humor and relentless intellectual curiosity, to wherever my next adventure may be. 

üìë What I know and am continuing to improve upon: 
- Natural language processing, machine learning, neural networks/deep learning, image recognition, and data visualization using Python
- SQL for database manipulation, management, and design
- Excel, Tableau for data analysis and visualization
- PowerBI for dashboards and business analytics
- R, STATA, SPSS for statistical/econometric analysis 
- Basic OOP in Java

üìù What I'm learning in class:
- AI applications in data science (search, deep learning, computer vision)
- Big data and large-scale computing
- Unstructured data analysis

üå± Projects:
- Use AI to create a motion 'fingerprint' (i.e. mapping walking patterns to individuals) using smartphone/smartwatch tracking data
- Social media analysis for market, corporation, and consumer trends (client: Athleta)

‚ö° Fun facts:
- avid (solo) traveler
- Muay Thai trainee 
- bookworm
